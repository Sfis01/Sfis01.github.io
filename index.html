                    <p>
                        Every Friday, SchoolMate will hold a talk-and-discuss session where students will be able to speak about the common problems they face in their academics, and how and what they would like to be improved on the SchoolMate Program. This will help students to ease out the pressure they face and to tackle the problems with confidence.

                    <h4>Weekly tests and reports</h4>
                    <p>
                        SchoolMate believes in practical and feedback-driven learning. With our weekly tests, students will be pushed to get used to real examination atmosphere. They will also be given a chance to express and explain what they learnt throughout the week. Weekly reports will also be generated to help students keep track of their progress.

                    <h4>Monthly reviews and reports</h4>
                    <p>
                        Apart from weekly reports, monthly reports will be generated, and their main goal will be just as the same as the weekly reports, to promote feedback-driven learning. Each student will be given a review individually on their academic strengths and weaknesses and show them possible steps to improve.

                    <h4>Exam guide-throughs and time management skills</h4>
                    <p>
                        Students will be given step-by-step methods on tackling real exam questions, how to get the most from the exam, and how to minimize common exam mistakes. SchoolMate also believes that discipline and time management skills are keys to exam success, that’s why there will  be special cases when students will have taught them and showed how to apply them in the exam.

                        SchoolMate understands that students may miss, or completely not understand a concept when taught in class, that’s why we also dedicate ourselves on helping students understand lessons individually.

                        This technique is uniquely designed by SchoolMate to promote feedback-driven learning. Students will be awarded points for every effort they make. These points will be included in both weekly and monthly reports as a motivation to the student. Students can also use points to purchase stationery and other related items.
